# Keycloak In A Box
I repeatedly need an SSO identity provider.  The purpose of this project is to provide an out-of-the box solution.  It
contains a configured Test realm with an oidc-client. The client already has a number of users all pre-configured.

## Work in Progress

## Current State
1. Postgres database for Keycloak data.  This database maintains its data from run to run.
2. Added local-keycloak network.
3. Todo: Add Keycloak service.
4. Todo: preconfigure data
